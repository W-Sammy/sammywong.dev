                    <div id="Introduction">
                        <p>I am a student at California State University-Sacramento majoring in 
                            Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. My experience spans several
                            languages including Java, HTML, and CSS. I have a passion for all things 
                            tech-from IT infrastructure to AI/ML developments. 
                            <br><br>
                            In my free time, you'll find me diving into a good book, experimenting with 
                            new espresso brewing techniques, or enjoying a gaming session fueled by a perfectly
                            crafted shot. I've had the pleasure of working with Pulse Professional Services - a web services startup, focusing
                            on web design, SEO, and chatbot development. My journey from there has led me to working 
                            under CoveredCA's IT department where I was able polish my technical skills through direct
                            user interaction. Now I am part of the Enterprise Tools Team at the Legislative Data Center, 
                            where I provide software support, manage configurations, and develop solutions to enhance California's legislative processes.
